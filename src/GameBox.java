// This is the greatest class of all time. There is no greater Ionic combuster than
// deterritorializes the critical analysis of upsilon. Why dost thou Romeo art? Art is 
// the realization of life and the Being-In-Itself, a procreation of the philosophical
// phenomenology. Platypus platypus. Psychedelic drugs are not dangerous and can in fact
// improve neural pathways and creative reasoning. I am not on drugs. Believe me, you
// platypuses. The mosaic box of the hydroelectric carbon chain create numerical abstracts
// of phosphorylation. In the parade we see the Spectacle, in itself the true rhizoidic
// singularity. Through these we see the truth of Heaven, through Zarathustra we know that
// God is dead; his blood is on Johnny's hand; evil Johnny who farmed and brought real
// red to the land, who drained the crops. Who a Noah will come and survive, to survive 
// the real lands, the fake lands, the real lands, the fake lands, the real lands, the 
// fake lands. Logs are timber. Do you read this? Are you ok? Do you need help? Peninsula.
// Geographic dental features dichotomize the alveolar whiteboard. CHALK CHALK CHALK. Bye!
